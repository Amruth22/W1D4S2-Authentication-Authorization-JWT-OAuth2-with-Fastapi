# Authentication and Authorization with JWT and OAuth2 - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive authentication and authorization system using JWT tokens and OAuth2 patterns with FastAPI. This project focuses on implementing secure user authentication, role-based access control, and modern security practices including password hashing, token management, and rate limiting for production-ready applications.

## Project Objectives

1. **JWT Authentication Implementation:** Master JSON Web Token (JWT) creation, validation, and management for stateless authentication in modern web applications.

2. **OAuth2 Security Patterns:** Implement OAuth2 authentication flows with proper token handling, refresh mechanisms, and security best practices.

3. **Role-Based Access Control:** Design and implement role-based authorization systems that control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.

4. **Security Best Practices:** Learn password hashing, secure token storage, rate limiting, and other security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.

5. **User Management Systems:** Build comprehensive user registration, login, and profile management systems with proper validation and error handling.

6. **API Security Integration:** Integrate authentication and authorization seamlessly with FastAPI endpoints using dependency injection and security middleware.

## Key Features to Implement

- JWT-based authentication system with token generation, validation, and expiration handling
- Role-based authorization with different user roles (reader, author) and permission-based access control
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt with proper salt generation and verification
- Rate limiting implementation to prevent brute force attacks and API abuse
- User registration and login endpoints with comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Protected API endpoints demonstrating different authorization levels and access control patterns

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Security Architecture:** Understanding authentication vs authorization, token-based security, and stateless authentication patterns
- **JWT Implementation:** Learning JWT structure, claims, signing algorithms, and security considerations for token-based systems
- **Password Security:** Implementing secure password handling including hashing, salting, and verification best practices
- **Rate Limiting:** Building effective rate limiting strategies to prevent abuse while maintaining good user experience
- **Authorization Patterns:** Designing flexible authorization systems that can handle complex permission requirements
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Understanding and preventing common security issues like token theft, replay attacks, and privilege escalation
- **API Security Integration:** Seamlessly integrating security measures with API endpoints without compromising performance or usability

## Expected Outcome

You will create a production-ready authentication and authorization system that demonstrates modern security practices and can serve as a foundation for secure web applications. The system will provide comprehensive user management with proper security controls and access management.

## Additional Considerations

- Implement advanced security features including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and account lockout mechanisms
- Add support for OAuth2 integration with external providers (Google, GitHub, etc.) for social authentication
- Create comprehensive audit logging for security events and user activities
- Implement token refresh mechanisms and secure token revocation capabilities
- Add support for fine-grained permissions and resource-based access control
- Create security monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities and potential security breaches
- Consider implementing session management, CSRF protection, and other web security measures
